Message-server
==============

A 2nd year project to make a server with a protocol on how to handle messages.

Start by running the server then running either the agent to do your own tests or multi-agent to run concurrent pre-made tests.

Then run the jar file attached in release to try with a more user friendly enviroment, the port is: 12111


The GUI is in the release folder as it is a jar file, but the server needs its source downloading and class file created then run before trying to connect through the GUI.
